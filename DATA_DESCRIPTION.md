| Country_Code         | char(2)      | The unique two-letter identifier for the country from ISO 3166; see http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Country_Name         | varchar(40)  | The name used for the country in Ethnologue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Languages            | integer      | The number of living languages for this country. It is the sum of Established plus Immigrant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Indigenous           | integer      | The number of LIC records in this country for languages that are living and are indigenous to the country (that is, where EGIDS < “x10” and Is_Indigenous = “T”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Established          | integer      | The number of LIC records in this country for languages that are living and are well-established within the country (that is, where EGIDS < “x10” and Is_Established = “T”). See the documentation of Is_Established below for the full definition of what constitutes an “established” language.                                                                                         |
| Immigrant            | integer      | The number of LIC records in this country for languages that have recently immigrated (that is, where Is_Established = “F”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Diversity            | decimal(4,3) | The Greenberg diversity index. This is the probability that any two people of the country selected at random would have different mother tongues. The highest possible value, 1, indicates total diversity (that is, no two people have the same mother tongue) while the lowest possible value, 0, indicates no diversity at all (that is, everyone has the same mother tongue). |
| Included             | integer      | The number of languages in the country for which population estimates are available and which are therefore included in the calculation of the diversity index. Comparing this number to the value in the Languages column gives an indication of the relative coverage of the diversity calculation.                                                                                   |
| Sum_Of_Populations   | integer      | The sum of the first-language speaker populations of all languages in this country for which the population is known. This number differs from Population in that the latter is the latest estimate of the national population. The first-language speaker populations reported in Ethnologue are the latest known reported estimates rather than an extrapolation based on presumed growth rates. Thus Sum_of_Populations always lags behind Population. |
| Mean                 | integer      | The mean first-language speaker population of a language in the country. It is Sum_of_Populations divided by Included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Median               | integer      | The median first-language speaker population of a language in the country. That is, half of the languages are larger than this size, and half are smaller. (When there is an odd number of Included languages, it is the middle value when the populations are sorted into numerical order. When there is an even number, it is calculated as the average of the two middle values.)    |
| Population           | integer      | The population of the country. This figure is taken from the most recent national census data where available or the current estimated population from the United Nations or another reliable source. See the Ethnologue page of the relevant country for the specific source information.                                                                                                  |
| Literacy_Rate        | decimal(3,2) | This is an estimate of the proportion of the population in the country that is literate in any language of the country. Data are primarily from UNESCO but may also come from various other sources if more recent estimates are available. See the Ethnologue page of the relevant country for the specific source information.                                                          |
